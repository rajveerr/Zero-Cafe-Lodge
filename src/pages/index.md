  title: Welcome to ZERO
  description: Overlooking the beautiful sight of Aravali hills, away from the
    chaos of Jaipur city yet in close proximity from ‘The Amer Fort’, glancing
    into the heritage and culture of Royal Rajputana. ZERO is a luxurious lodge
    that combines the glorious history with modern lifestyle. Glittering with
    the glass work influenced from royal Sheesh Mahals, gracefully embodying the
    beautiful swimming pool, waterfall and rooftop surrounded by the greenery
    makes for an exclusive event venue and bespoke residence.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
